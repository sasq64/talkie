# The Lurking Horror - Game Facts

This document contains extracted information from the game manual and feelies for "The Lurking Horror" by Infocom. It is intended to be a reference for players.

## Section I: About The Lurking Horror

### Preface to the Story

In The Lurking Horror, you are a student at G.U.E. Tech. You have braved a snowstorm to get to the Computer Center and finish work on an assignment. But the snowstorm has turned into a raging blizzard, and has trapped you in a complex of buildings late at night. You are not alone, fortunately -- or perhaps, unfortunately.

### About the Author

Dave Lebling was born in Washington, D.C., in a hospital that was torn down soon thereafter. He grew up in suburban Maryland. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and worked at M.I.T.'s Laboratory for Computer Science, where he developed an interest in computer entertainments. He co-authored the original mainframe Zork. He co-authored Zork I, Zork II, Zork III, and Enchanter, and wrote Starcross, Suspect, and Spellbreaker on his own. He is married and lives in a suburb of Boston, on a windblown hill crowned by a covered ring of stones. He hopes the noises in the walls are the heating system.

## Section II: About Infocom's Interactive Fiction

### An Overview: What is interactive fiction?

Interactive fiction is a story in which you are the main character. Each interactive story, such as The Lurking Horror, presents you with a series of locations, items, characters, and events. You can affect the direction of the story by moving from place to place, using the objects you find, and interacting with the other characters. An important element of interactive fiction is puzzle-solving.

In The Lurking Horror, time passes only in response to your input. Nothing happens until you type a sentence and press the RETURN (or ENTER) key.

To measure your progress, The Lurking Horror keeps track of your score. You may get points for solving puzzles, performing certain actions, or visiting certain locations. A perfect score of 100 is your goal.

### Starting and Stopping

*   **Starting the story:** To load The Lurking Horror, follow the instructions on the Reference Card in your package. On your screen, you will see a description of the opening location of the story, Terminal Room, followed by the prompt (>).
