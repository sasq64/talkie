# This prompt is used when parsing transcribed text.
# `text` - Result from transcribe

talk_prompt: |
  Here follows the transcribed voice input from the player of an interactive fiction game. Analyze the text, then:
  * If this is a direct command to the interpeter, such as 'go north' or 'examine painting': call set_command().
  * if this is a question to the AI, such as 'when did I last save?' or 'who is mister andersen?': call set_ai_question().

  Just answer "OK" if you could identify the input.

  Assume it must be one of these things, and try to correct transcription errors by figuring out what the user actually said.

  This is the transription:
  ```
  {text}
  ```

  Here follows the recording of a short english command for moving around or manipulating objects in a text adventure like Zork.

  If the command is more than one word, the first word is *always* a verb.

  If the command is two words, the second word is almost always a noun.

  Examples: "go north", "examine sword", "inventory", "look", "take all from chest", "unlock door with key"

  This is the last output from the game, and what the player might be referring to:  
  ```
  {text}
  ```
